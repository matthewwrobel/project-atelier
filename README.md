# Project Atelier

Project Atelier is a front-end application built with **React** that simulates an e-commerce shopping experience. It was built for a group project as part of Hack Reactor's part-time Software Engineering Immersive program.

## Usage

If you're interested in trying out what we've built, feel free to download or clone our source code! Then go to the directory where you copied the code using your Terminal (assuming you're using a Mac) and:

1. Type ```npm install``` to download all the necessary dependencies (see below for more info on these)
2. Type ```npm start``` to start the server (it's running on port :8080)
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser and check it out!

You can also use ```npm run server-dev``` to run the server using **nodemon**, and ```npm run react-dev``` to run **webpack** (it's already configured to watch for file changes).
